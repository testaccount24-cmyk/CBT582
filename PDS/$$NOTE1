I got curious when I saw the MVS 3.8j specific file for TAPEMAP
on the CBT site (file 582). I downloaded it, assembled it, and
tried it. It insists that today is Wednesday. I'm not sure that I
believe that; after looking at the code I still don't know what
he was trying to do. I yanked all of it and replaced it by
something shorter that works (all files in the attached ZIP were
downloaded with IND$FILE from sequential files, without
translation).

Due to some discussion on the H390 group, I looked at the
Waterloo G assembler, and discovered I needed PDSLOAD for that. I
had a copy, never linked, so I did that. I also ran compares
against the twenty odd copies on the turnkey system, and they're
all a match except that I inserted your comments. I have not
checked it against the version in the current file 93. When I
need to update using non './' control cards, I usually use
Cornell's IEBUPDTX, but decided to try PDSLOAD; I found that it
can't handle what I needed - groups of IEBUPDTE packets with ./,
with each group having a non ./ ADD card. So I redid PDSLOAD to
accept CTL(xx) to handle that case, concurrently with the
UPDTE(yy) option. I also got disgusted with the sequential PARM
entry checks, and rolled them up into a loop. Updated version
(tested in MVS 3.8) enclosed.

I'm changing ISPs - my new e-mail address is gerhardp (at)
charter (dot) net - I finally sprung for a high-speed interface
that for six years they've been telling me wasn't available on my
road (I had their cabling in my house!).
